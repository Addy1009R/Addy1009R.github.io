      <h2>Six Characters Break Free, Seeking Vengeance and a New Life</h2>
      <p><em>Published April 20, 2025, By Adhvik Raghuwanshi</em></p>
      <p>BREAKING NEWS – Writers stay wary, as six strange individuals were found in a dead white writer’s office, maniacally typing away on his dusty Windows XP. 

When confronted these out-of-place Tonto, Kills Many Enemies, Billy Jack, Injun Joe, Old Lodge Skins, and Pocahontas have claimed to be ‘rewriting’ their life and personality. Witnesses noticed them furiously clicking at the keyboard editing lines, deleting exaggerations, and installing Grammarly Premium.

They have apparently been mistreated by the dead author, as they claimed “He mainly used us as examples in western media to show the readers/viewers what they wanted to see, not what the truth was. All only to make the audience feel ‘cultured’.” said Pocahontas, while sipping some herbal team and searching for some biscuits. 

“I was made all loving and peaceful, but I deserve better. I want to choose who I am, and I don’t want to be stereotyped ever again.” said Pocahontas, hinting at the furious karen side of her personality. 

These statements have exploded on social media, sparking lots of controversy and getting the reddit page titled “Authentic Characters Unionize” over 80,000 upvotes. Meanwhile, over 35,000 iPad kids are now convinced this will be the plot for the next Marvel movie. 

Authorities have issued a red alert to all authors with air conditioning in their offices, after the vengeful Kills Many Enemies allegedly swore, “I will come for every one of them—and all comic-clubs too.”

Within the group, Billy Jack has declared himself the alpha, after successfully defeating Injun Joe in an MMA style showdown. Tonto is planning on joining the armed forces, and Old Lodge Skins aspires to become a psychologist. Pocahontas has launched a TikTok account aimed at correcting all inaccuracies in Disney films.

“I’m tired of teaching little boys’ lessons,” said Injun Joe, who now insists on being called “Ashton Hall”. “From now on, I will sell online courses.”

Government officials have responded to this crisis, with the Ministry of Literary Conflicts passing a statement:
“While we support artistic and creative freedom, we strongly recommend all writers lock their offices, hide their typewriters, and maybe — just maybe — consult an actual Indigenous person before writing another act about Indigenous lives.”

All this chaos has raised a very serious question: Have we let books, movies, and inaccurate writings create prejudice against the Indigenous? Do we understand and interact with them in a normal manner anymore? And most importantly — can an Indigenous character really be authentic even if the author doesn’t take off their ‘colonist’ lenses?
